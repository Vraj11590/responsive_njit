responsive_njit
===============


I decided to take the njit webiste and make it responsive.

The reasons why i could not finish tihs project is due to the fact that i have been dealing with things outside of school
that are mainly psychological. I have done as much as i could have, in the time that i could work on it. I have tried my best
in making it as neat as possible. 

The mobile.css is the file that has all the media queries.

there are three responses
mobile
table/ipad
desktop

mobile is without the content div, but the menus all realign
tablet/ipad does not do anything except realign the div's
desktop looks good but is without the content also. 

The (.ai) files show how i would have shown the content of the page after it re-adjusts.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to hand it in three days late. I worked on it up until now.
